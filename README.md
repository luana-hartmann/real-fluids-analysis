# Liquid-Vapor Equilibrium - Thermodynamic Properties of Real Fluids

This repository contains a Python script for analyzing liquid-vapor equilibrium and the thermodynamic properties of real fluids. The project was developed as part of the **TQA II** course and implements calculations to obtain the saturation curve of a fluid.

## Description
The code uses the Peng-Robinson equation of state to calculate the equilibrium pressure of a real fluid. It compares the calculated values with experimental data and generates saturation curve graphs.

### Key Features:
- Equilibrium pressure calculation using the Peng-Robinson equation
- Determination of compressibility factors (Zl and Zv)
- Fugacity coefficient calculation
- Generation of tables and graphs for result analysis

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`

## Results
The results include a comparison between experimental and calculated pressures, as well as saturation graphs:

- Graph 1: Temperature vs. Experimental Pressure
- Graph 2: Temperature vs. Calculated Pressure
